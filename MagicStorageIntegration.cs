	// This code can be used as an example of weak references.
	// The most important part of weak references is remembering to test your mod with the referenced .tmod file deleted and a fresh start of tModLoader. (To clear the loaded assemblies.)
	// If you do not, the mod might crash. Testing on non-windows machines is also important.
	// Here we show a few pitfalls that might cause a TypeInitializationException to be thrown.
	// Remember, you have to gate all access to Types and Methods defined in the weakly referenced mod or it will crash.
	// All calls to methods in this class by this mod besides Load and Unload are gated with a check to Enabled.

		// Here we define a bool property to quickly check if MagicStorage is loaded. 
		public static bool Enabled => MagicStorage != null;
		// Below is an alternate approach to the Enabled property seen above. 
		// To make sure an up-to-date version of the referenced mod is being used, usually we write "MagicStorage@0.4.3.1" in build.txt.
		// This, however, would throw an error if the 0.4.1 were loaded. 
		// This approach, with the @0.4.3.1 removed from the weakReferences in build.txt and the Version check added to Enabled below,
		// allows older versions of MagicStorage to load alongside this mod even though the integration won't work.
		// Usually letting tModLoader handle the version requirement and forcing your users to update their mods is easier and better.

		// I opted to keep the MagicStorage integration logic in the MagicStorageIntegration class to keep MagicStorage related code as sparse and unobtrusive as possible within the remaining codebase for this mod.
		// That said, in ItemChecklistPlayer, we see this:
		//	if (ItemChecklistUI.collectChestItems && MagicStorageIntegration.Enabled)
		//		MagicStorageIntegration.FindItemsInStorage();
		// I could have changed this to always call FindItemsInStorage and have FindItemsInStorage check Enabled, but that would require a FindItemsInStorage_Inner type class once again to prevent errors.
